# JavaChatangoBot

This bot library is a Room and Pms Chatango bot written in Java. It Uses a GUI that has the ability to login, send messages to chats and Pms with the GUI, and also uses console commands with the GUI to change things about the bot or room(like font , bans , mods , deletes , and many other things). There are 3 classes , the Main class , Rooms class , and Pms class. Finished linking with my A.I.M.L.(Artificial Intelligence Markup Language ) bot code so that it uses AI. The bot can do all things related to using a Chatango site such as searching , posting, getting mods, premium, wl, blocks, bans, and the list goes on and on.

Welcome to the Foxdust fork!  I used this chatbot for something else and improved it along the way, so I've come back and forked it properly to share some of those improvements, including but not limited to the ability to actually disconnect and reconnect the bot.  Enjoy!
